Question : Difference between --force push and --force-with-lease, You have to show the use of both, also you have to show in what scenario --force-with-lease is used?

Answer :

1. --force push is used to push the changes to the remote repository.
    whenever you push changes to the remote repository, git try to find a linear
    path between local and remote commit if the path is not found, git push will fail

    to solve this problem we can use --force to forcefully push the changes to the remote repository.

    Example : in previous question we have used rebase command to delete a commit
    suppose your team member have pushed a commit to the remote repository and you want to make some changes to your older commits
    and you did not do git pull to get the latest changes from the remote repository pushed by your team member
    and you used the rebase command to change the commit on your local repository but now
    when you tries to push the changes to the remote repository, git will not find a linear path between local and remote commit
    and git push will fail.then you can use --force to forcefully push the changes to the remote repository.

2. --force-with-lease is used to push the changes to the remote repository.
    this flag allow us to push --force our changes but with a guarantee that we wonâ€™t overwrite any changes that have been pushed to the remote repository by someone else

    scenarios when we use --force-with-lease :
    Rebase a branch onto another branch,
    Rewording a commit in the past,
    Squashing a few commits together,
    Reordering the commits, or
    Changing the author of a previous commit.
